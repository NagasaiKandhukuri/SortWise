# **App Name**: SortWise

## Core Features:

- Algorithm Explanation: Detailed explanations of common sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort).
- Interactive Visualization: Animated visualization of each sorting algorithm, allowing users to step through the sorting process, pause, reset, and input their own data.
- Complexity Analysis: Display the Big O analysis for each algorithm and use a tool to explain in plain english how these algorithmic efficiencies relate to the use case.
- Algorithm Comparison: Compare algorithms using a summary table with the Big O notation in a chart format for best, average, and worst case.
- User Input: Allow users to input their own array of numbers to visualize how the algorithm works.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vivid blue (#4285F4) to convey trust and intelligence, suitable for educational content.
- Background color: Light blue (#E3F2FD), very low saturation to create a light background
- Accent color: Yellow-orange (#FFB300) to highlight key interactive elements and provide contrast.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font with a clean, modern, objective style. Good for educational body and head text.
- Use a set of simple and clear icons to represent different features and actions within the visualizations.
- Employ a clean, minimalist design with clear sections for explanation, visualization, and code examples.
- Use smooth, subtle animations in the visualizations to enhance understanding without overwhelming the user.
